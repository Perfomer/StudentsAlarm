# StudentsAlarm-2017

**WARNING! This project is deprecated. The [new version](https://github.com/Perfomer/WelloAlarm-2017/tree/master) is rewritten from scratch. The code style, architecture and quality of technology use reflected in this project are no longer relevant. **

**Alarm app for Android OS. Perfect for students with 2-weeks graphic.**

Today, most Russian universities have a 2-week timetable. Ordinary alarm clocks can not work with such a schedule so that you do not have to switch it every time.

I solved this problem by creating this application. Here, in addition to selecting the call days, you can also specify the parity / oddness of the week in which it should ring.

The main principle of this application is to reduce useless taps on the screen to a minimum. Therefore, the program has built-in synchronization between devices of the same account - by purchasing a new phone, you only need to install this application, and all alarms will already be installed.

## Used technologies
- Java Core, Android SDK
- Google Firebase
